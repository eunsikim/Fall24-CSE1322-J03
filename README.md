# FAQ

1. **When are the grades posted on D2L?**
    - Grades will be synced by the next Sunday a lab or assignment is due. For example, Lab 1 is due on Sunday, August 25th 2024, therefore the grade for Lab 1 will be posted the next Sunday, September 1st 2024.
2. **My grades has been posted to D2L and I think there was a mistake in the grading, what can I do?**
    - After grades are posted onto D2L, you will be given a period of 3 business days to submit a regrade request. So, if grades are posted on a Sunday, the regrade period will last until Wednesday. To submit a regrade request, first double check the rubric. After your submission has been graded, you will be able to check the rubric we used by clicking on "Manual Grading". This will show the entirety of the Rubric, but only the rubric points highlighted in a white box and with a check mark are the points applied. This regrading policy does applies for Labs, Assignments, and even the Midterm and Final Exams so do always check for any mistakes.
